<p align = "left">
In this lab, we were required to create our own malloc, and increase its
 efficency in whatever way we could. 
 This was extremely complicated, as we had to keep track of our memory usage
 and manually permit ourselves to use it, as well as keep track of where we
 might have free memory or allocated memory. Created in C

<p align = "center"><h2 align = "center">Minesweeper </h2></p>
<p align = "left">
For Minesweeper,  We had to familiarize ourselves witha simple GUI and
 manipulate it so that you could play a game with it.  This included the tiles having a touch reaction, recursively revealing area where there was no mines 
or numbers surrounding a tile, and being able to randomly generate a winnable
game.  Created in Java
